# --------

# * = JDBC driver must be downloaded and installed in /drivers manually
# ** = TNS_ADMIN environment variable must point to the directory of where tnsnames.ora resides

# The default schema managed by Flyway. This schema name is case-sensitive. If not specified, but flyway.schemas
# is, Flyway uses the first schema in that list. If that is also not specified, Flyway uses the default schema for the
# database connection.
# Consequences:
# - This schema will be the one containing the schema history table.
# - This schema will be the default for the database connection (provided the database supports this concept).

# Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. (default: filesystem:<<INSTALL-DIR>>/sql)
# The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain
# both SQL and Java-based migrations.
#
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem, may only
# contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.
# Locations starting with s3: point to a bucket in AWS S3, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned
# recursively. They are in the format s3:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)
# Locations starting with gcs: point to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, may only contain SQL migrations, and are scanned
# recursively. They are in the format gcs:<bucket>(/optionalfolder/subfolder)
# Wildcards can be used to reduce duplication of location paths. (e.g. filesystem:migrations/*/oracle) Supported wildcards:
# ** : Matches any 0 or more directories
# *  : Matches any 0 or more non-separator characters
# ?  : Matches any 1 non-separator character
